You can find instructions for installing or updating these programs here.\nYou are only required to follow the instructions under the Install R and RStudio or Update R and RStudio sections. We will go over the remainder together during workshop #1.\n\n\nBring your own dataset(s) to Workshops 6 & 9\nThese workshops are taking place February 11 and April 15.\nPlease bring one or more datasets you hope to incoroprate into your own research for Workshops 6 & 9. We will be using the tools we’ve learned in importing and cleaning data in R as well as visualizing data in R with datasets you have collected during your RaMP training. Instructors will be available to answer questions and help troubleshoot solutions. We will be working together to try common data import and cleaning steps. This is a great time to troubleshoot errors too because it’s likely that more than one person will see the same error and the instructors will be available to walk through these issues. If you do not have your own data, please email Ana to talk about getting example datasets that you can use for these workshops!"

During this workshop, the instructors will ensure that everyone has successfully downloaded R and RStudio and completed the setup tasks outlined in the Setup tab.\nPresentation PDF available after workshop\n\n\n2. December 17: Getting Started in R and RStudio\nIn this workshop, we will get oriented to R and RStudio and how they work together. We will also talk about file and folder organization that will generally be helful for project management, but make it much easier to work with R programming on your computer. We will also quickly review why ecologists use R for data analysis.\nLive coding script available after workshop\n\n\n3. January 7: Data Visualization with ggplot2\nIn this workshop, we will learn how to visualize data in R and RStudio using a package called ggplot2\nLive coding script available after workshop\n\n\n4. January 14: Exploring and Understanding Data\nIn this workshop, we will dive a bit deeper into R and learn how R stores data and how different ways that R stores data can help ecologists working with R.\nLive coding script available after workshop\n\n\n5. February 4: Working with Data\nIn this workshop, we will learn how to import data into R and make these data easier to use for analysis and visualization.\nLive coding script available after workshop\n\n\n6. February 11: Working with Data, Part 2\nIn this workshop session, participants will continue to work on importing data into R. Participants may also be working to import their own datasets into R. We will process and visualize data together during the session and instructors will be available to troubleshoot issues with data in R.\nLive coding script available after workshop\n\n\n7. March 18: Introduction to Statistics in R\nIn this workshop, we will learn about how to run statistical tests in R. These will match statistical tests participants will already know how to do in the program JMP from earlier in the RaMP training.\nLive coding script available after workshop\n\n\n8.
