You can find instructions for installing or updating these programs here.\nYou are only required to follow the instructions under the Install R and RStudio or Update R and RStudio sections. We will go over the remainder together during workshop #1.\n\n\nBring your own dataset(s) to Workshops 6 & 9\nThese workshops are taking place February 11 and April 15.\nPlease bring one or more datasets you hope to incoroprate into your own research for Workshops 6 & 9. We will be using the tools we’ve learned in importing and cleaning data in R as well as visualizing data in R with datasets you have collected during your RaMP training. Instructors will be available to answer questions and help troubleshoot solutions. We will be working together to try common data import and cleaning steps. This is a great time to troubleshoot errors too because it’s likely that more than one person will see the same error and the instructors will be available to walk through these issues. If you do not have your own data, please email Ana to talk about getting example datasets that you can use for these workshops!"

During this workshop, the instructors will ensure that everyone has successfully downloaded R and RStudio and completed the setup tasks outlined in the Setup tab.\nPresentation PDF\n\n\n2. December 17: Getting Started in R and RStudio\nIn this workshop, we will get oriented to R and RStudio and how they work together. We will also talk about file and folder organization that will generally be helful for project management, but make it much easier to work with R programming on your computer. We will also quickly review why ecologists use R for data analysis.\nLive coding script\n\n\n3. January 7: Data Visualization with ggplot2\nIn this workshop, we will learn how to visualize data in R and RStudio using a package called ggplot2\nLive coding script\n\n\n4. January 14: Data Visualization with ggplot2 & Exploring and Understanding Data\nIn this workshop, we will dive a bit deeper into R and learn how R stores data and how different ways that R stores data can help ecologists working with R.\nLive coding script\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it on your own!\n\n\n\nTry making your own plot! You can run str(complete_old) or ?complete_old to explore variables you might use in your new plot. Feel free to use variables we have already seen, or some we haven’t explored yet.\nHere are a couple ideas to get you started:\n\nmake a histogram of one of the numeric variables\ntry using a different color scale_\ntry changing the size of points or thickness of lines in a geom\n\nYou can explore some plotting option in the R Graph Gallery or get ideas about types of plots with the ggplot2 cheat sheet (which is also available in RStudio in the Help tab on the top of RStudio window).\n\n\n\n\n5. February 4: Exploring and Understanding Data\nIn this workshop, we continued to explore how R understands data.\nLive coding script\n\n\n6. February 11: Exploring and Understanding Data & Working with Data, Part 2\nIn this workshop session, we will continue to explore and understand how R looks at data. We will then work on importing data into R. We will then perform common data exploration and cleaning steps and the final step will be to export a “clean” dataset.\nLive coding script 1\nLive coding script 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it on your own!\n\n\n\nUsing the steps we used to import a dataset in this workshop, try importing one of your own datasets into R. If you don’t have your own dataset yet, explore some options at the Ecological Dataset Wiki. Explore the data using one or more of the functions we used today (select, filter, or mutate). What did you learn about the data? In a nutshell:\n\nuse read_csv function to import a dataset into R\nExplore the dataset with one or more of the functions select, filter, and mutate\nWhat did you learn about the dataset using these functions that can help you understand and work with your data better?\n\n\n\n\n\n7. March 18: Exploring and Understanding Data & Introduction to Statistics in R\nIn this workshop, we will continue to explore data in R. We will also learn about how to run statistical tests in R. These will match statistical tests participants will already know how to do in the program JMP from earlier in the RaMP training.\nLive coding script available after workshop\n\n\n8. March 25: Introduction to Statistics in R 2\nIn this workshop, we will continue to learn about how to run statistical tests in R. These will match statistical tests participants will already know how to do in the program JMP from earlier in the RaMP training.\nLive coding script available after workshop\n\n\n9. April 15: Working with Data, Part 3\nIn this workshop session, participants will continue to import their own datasets into R. We will process and visualize data together during the session and instructors will be available to troubleshoot issues with data in R. We will also explore statistical analyses with participant datasets.\nLive coding script available after workshop"
