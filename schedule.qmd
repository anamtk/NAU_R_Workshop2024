### 1. December 10: Why R?

In this workshop, we will walk through an overview of R and why it is so useful for ecologists. During this workshop, the instructors will ensure that everyone has successfully downloaded R and RStudio and completed the setup tasks outlined in the [Setup](https://anamtk.github.io/NAU_R_Workshop2024/setup.html) tab.

### 2. December 17: [Getting Started in R and RStudio](https://datacarpentry.github.io/R-ecology-lesson-alternative/introduction-r-rstudio.html)

In this workshop, we will get oriented to R and RStudio and how they work together. We will also talk about file and folder organization that will generally be helful for project management, but make it much easier to work with R programming on your computer. We will also quickly review why ecologists use R for data analysis.

### 3. January 7: [Data Visualization with `ggplot2`](https://datacarpentry.github.io/R-ecology-lesson-alternative/visualizing-ggplot.html)

In this workshop, we will learn how to visualize data in R and RStudio using a package called `ggplot2`

### 4. January 14: [Exploring and Understanding Data](https://datacarpentry.github.io/R-ecology-lesson-alternative/how-r-thinks-about-data.html)

In this workshop, we will dive a bit deeper into R and learn how R stores data and how different ways that R stores data can help ecologists working with R.

### 6. February 11: [Working with Data, Part 2](https://datacarpentry.github.io/R-ecology-lesson-alternative/working-with-data.html)

In this workshop session, participants will continue to work on importing data into R. Participants may also be working to import their own datasets into R. We will process and visualize data together during the session and instructors will be available to troubleshoot issues with data in R.

### 7. March 18: [Introduction to Statistics in R](https://anamtk.github.io/stats_workshop/Introduction_to_Statistics.html)

In this workshop, we will learn about how to run statistical tests in R. These will match statistical tests participants will already know how to do in the program JMP from earlier in the RaMP training.
